# RIME Protocol

RIME Protocol is a decentralized lending platform that enables users to borrow RUSD, a stablecoin pegged to the US dollar, by providing collateral in the form of Conflux (CFX). RIME aims to empower users with financial freedom by offering a zero-interest borrowing solution while ensuring the stability and security of the system through overcollateralization and robust governance.

Key features of the RIME Protocol include:

1. **Decentralized Lending**: RIME allows users to borrow RUSD without relying on centralized financial institutions, providing a trustless and censorship-resistant platform.
2. **Zero-Interest Borrowing**: Users can borrow RUSD at a 0% interest rate, enabling them to access liquidity without the burden of high-interest loans.
3. **Multiple Collateral Types**: The platform supports both CFX as collateral assets, offering users flexibility in their borrowing choices.
4. **Overcollateralization**: To ensure the stability of the RUSD stablecoin, RIME requires loans to be overcollateralized, reducing the risk of undercollateralized loans and protecting the ecosystem.
5. **Liquidation Process**: RIME implements a liquidation process to maintain the system's stability in case of collateral value fluctuations, incentivizing users to maintain a healthy collateral ratio.
6. **Stability Pool**: Users can deposit RUSD into the Stability Pool to earn RMT rewards and contribute to the overall stability of the platform.
7. **RMT Token**: RMT is a utility token that allows users to participate in the RIME ecosystem, earning rewards from liquidations and sharing platform revenue.

RIME Protocol is committed to providing a user-friendly, secure, and efficient lending platform, unlocking the potential of decentralized finance for users around the world.
