# Overview of RIME

RIME is a decentralized lending protocol built on the Conflux blockchain that enables users to obtain interest-free loans using Conflux (CFX) and CNHC as collateral. The platform issues RUSD, a stablecoin pegged to the US dollar, as loans to users who provide sufficient collateral.

RIME is designed to provide a secure, transparent, and user-friendly experience for borrowers, as well as offer additional opportunities for users to earn rewards by participating in the Stability Pool and staking RMT tokens.

Key aspects of the RIME protocol include:

- Interest-free loans: Borrowers can access RUSD loans at 0% interest by collateralizing their CFX and CNHC assets.
- Flexible collateral options: RIME supports both Conflux (CFX) and CNHC as collateral, giving users the freedom to choose the best option for their needs.
- Decentralized and secure: Built on the Conflux blockchain, RIME is a decentralized protocol that prioritizes security and transparency.
- Liquidation mechanism: RIME features a dynamic and efficient liquidation process to maintain the stability of the system.
- Stability Pool: Users can participate in the Stability Pool to earn rewards from liquidations and contribute to the overall health of the RIME ecosystem.
- RMT token: The RMT token plays a crucial role in the RIME ecosystem, allowing users to earn rewards through staking and participating in the Stability Pool.

RIME is committed to driving the growth of the Conflux ecosystem and supporting the adoption of CNHC as an offshore RMB stablecoin. With strong partnerships with Conflux and CNHC, RIME is well-positioned to continue its development and expansion
