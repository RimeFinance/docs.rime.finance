## How to Manage Collateral

Follow these steps to manage your collateral on the RIME platform:

### 1. Access the RIME Platform

Visit the RIME platform at [https://rime.finance](https://rime.finance). Navigate to the borrowing interface.

### 2. View Your Loan Details

Check your current loan details, including the borrowed RUSD amount, collateralization ratio, and collateral type (CFX or CNHC).

### 3. Add Collateral

To increase your collateralization ratio, follow these steps:

1. Input the amount of additional collateral you want to add.
2. Review the updated collateralization ratio and confirm the transaction.
3. Sign the transaction in your wallet. Once the transaction is successful, your new collateralization ratio will be displayed.

### 4. Withdraw Collateral

If your collateralization ratio is higher than the required minimum, you can withdraw some collateral by following these steps:

1. Input the amount of collateral you want to withdraw.
2. Review the updated collateralization ratio and ensure it remains above the minimum required level.
3. Confirm the transaction and sign it in your wallet. Once the transaction is successful, the withdrawn collateral will be sent to your wallet.

### 5. Repay RUSD

You can repay RUSD to reduce your loan balance and improve your collateralization ratio. Follow these steps:

1. Input the amount of RUSD you want to repay.
2. Review the updated collateralization ratio and confirm the transaction.
3. Sign the transaction in your wallet. Once the transaction is successful, your new loan balance and collateralization ratio will be displayed.

Remember to monitor your collateralization ratio regularly and ensure it remains above the minimum required level to avoid liquidation. By managing your collateral and repaying RUSD when needed, you can maintain a healthy collateralization ratio and minimize the risk of liquidation.
