<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h3 id="borrowing-rusd"><a class="header" href="#borrowing-rusd">Borrowing RUSD</a></h3>
<p>RUSD is the stablecoin issued by the RIME Protocol. It's designed to maintain a stable value of 1 USD. Users can borrow RUSD by pledging CFX and CNHC as collateral, providing them with the flexibility to leverage their assets without the need to sell them.</p>
<h4 id="steps-to-borrow-rusd"><a class="header" href="#steps-to-borrow-rusd">Steps to Borrow RUSD</a></h4>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Connect your wallet</strong>: Visit the RIME Protocol platform at <a href="https://rime.finance">https://rime.finance</a> and connect your supported wallet (e.g., MetaMask, imToken, Fluent Wallet).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Choose collateral type</strong>: Select the type of collateral you'd like to pledge, either CFX or CNHC. Ensure that you have sufficient funds in your wallet to cover the collateral and any associated transaction fees.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Enter the amount of RUSD to borrow</strong>: Specify the amount of RUSD you'd like to borrow. Keep in mind that the total value of your collateral must be greater than the minimum collateral ratio required by the RIME Protocol (e.g., 150%).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Review your position</strong>: Before confirming the transaction, review your collateral and RUSD loan details, including the collateralization ratio, liquidation price, and other relevant information.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Confirm the transaction</strong>: If you're satisfied with the loan details, confirm the transaction in your wallet. Once the transaction is processed, the RUSD loan will be deposited into your wallet.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Please note that borrowing RUSD carries certain risks, such as potential liquidation if the value of your collateral falls below the minimum required ratio. Be sure to monitor your collateralization ratio and adjust it as necessary to avoid liquidation.</p>
<p>Additionally, always practice proper risk management and only borrow amounts you're comfortable with, considering the inherent volatility of cryptocurrencies.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="collateral-requirements-cfx-and-cnhc"><a class="header" href="#collateral-requirements-cfx-and-cnhc">Collateral Requirements (CFX and CNHC)</a></h1>
<p>To borrow RUSD through the RIME Protocol, users must provide collateral in the form of CFX or CNHC. The collateral requirements are designed to ensure the stability and security of the RUSD stablecoin and protect the interests of both borrowers and the RIME ecosystem.</p>
<h2 id="minimum-collateral-ratio"><a class="header" href="#minimum-collateral-ratio">Minimum Collateral Ratio</a></h2>
<p>The RIME Protocol requires borrowers to maintain a minimum collateral ratio for their loans. This ratio is calculated as the total value of the collateral divided by the amount of RUSD borrowed. The minimum collateral ratio ensures that loans are overcollateralized, providing a buffer against market volatility and reducing the risk of undercollateralized loans.</p>
<p>For example, if the minimum collateral ratio is 150%, and a user wants to borrow 100 RUSD, they must provide at least 150 USD worth of CFX or CNHC as collateral.</p>
<h2 id="liquidation"><a class="header" href="#liquidation">Liquidation</a></h2>
<p>If the collateral value falls below the minimum required ratio, the loan becomes at risk of liquidation. Liquidation is a process where the RIME Protocol automatically sells a portion of the borrower's collateral to repay the outstanding RUSD debt and restore the collateral ratio.</p>
<p>To avoid liquidation, borrowers should monitor their collateral ratios and add more collateral or repay a portion of their RUSD loans if necessary. It's essential to consider the volatility of the collateral assets and maintain a sufficient buffer above the minimum collateral ratio.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-manage-collateral"><a class="header" href="#how-to-manage-collateral">How to Manage Collateral</a></h2>
<p>RIME Protocol provides an intuitive interface for users to manage their collateral. Users can easily add or remove collateral, repay RUSD loans, and check their current collateralization ratios. To learn more about managing collateral, please refer to the <a href="rime_protocol/./guides_tutorials/manage_collateral.html">How to Manage Collateral</a> guide.</p>
<p>In summary, maintaining an adequate collateral ratio is crucial for borrowers using the RIME Protocol. By carefully managing their collateral, users can minimize the risk of liquidation and maximize the benefits of borrowing RUSD.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="liquidation-in-the-rime-protocol"><a class="header" href="#liquidation-in-the-rime-protocol">Liquidation in the RIME Protocol</a></h1>
<p>Liquidation is an important process in the RIME Protocol to ensure the system remains stable and well-collateralized. This guide will explain how liquidation works in the RIME Protocol and how you can protect your Trove from being liquidated.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-liquidation"><a class="header" href="#what-is-liquidation">What is Liquidation?</a></h2>
<p>Liquidation occurs when a Trove's collateral ratio falls below the minimum requirement. In this case, any liquidator can trigger the liquidation process to recover the outstanding RUSD debt. The liquidated collateral is then distributed to the Stability Pool and RIME Token stakers as a reward for maintaining the system's stability.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-protect-your-trove-from-liquidation"><a class="header" href="#how-to-protect-your-trove-from-liquidation">How to Protect Your Trove from Liquidation</a></h2>
<p>To protect your Trove from liquidation, it's essential to maintain a healthy collateral ratio at all times. Here are some steps you can take to prevent your Trove from being liquidated:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Monitor your collateral ratio</strong>: Keep an eye on your Trove's collateral ratio and ensure it remains above the minimum requirement. You can use the RIME web app to track your Trove's health and receive notifications about potential risks.</li>
<li><strong>Add more collateral</strong>: If your collateral ratio is approaching the minimum requirement, consider depositing additional CFX or CNHC to increase your collateral ratio and create a safety buffer.</li>
<li><strong>Repay RUSD debt</strong>: Another way to increase your collateral ratio is to repay some of your RUSD debt. This will decrease the amount of RUSD you owe and improve your Trove's health.</li>
<li><strong>Diversify your collateral</strong>: RIME Protocol allows you to use both CFX and CNHC as collateral. By diversifying your collateral types, you can reduce the impact of market fluctuations on your Trove's health.</li>
</ol>
<p>By following these steps, you can protect your Trove from liquidation and ensure a stable borrowing experience with the RIME Protocol. Remember to monitor your Trove's health and take action when necessary to maintain a healthy collateral ratio.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="stability-pool-in-the-rime-protocol"><a class="header" href="#stability-pool-in-the-rime-protocol">Stability Pool in the RIME Protocol</a></h1>
<p>The Stability Pool plays a critical role in maintaining the overall health and stability of the RIME Protocol. In this guide, you'll learn about the Stability Pool's function, its importance in the RIME ecosystem, and how you can participate.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-the-stability-pool"><a class="header" href="#what-is-the-stability-pool">What is the Stability Pool?</a></h2>
<p>The Stability Pool is a decentralized pool of RUSD that acts as a buffer against fluctuations in the value of the collateral backing the RUSD loans. When a Trove is liquidated, the Stability Pool absorbs the liquidated debt, and in return, participants in the Stability Pool receive a share of the liquidated collateral.</p>
<p>By contributing RUSD to the Stability Pool, participants help maintain the stability of the RIME Protocol while earning rewards in the form of liquidated collateral and RMT tokens.</p>
<h2 id="why-is-the-stability-pool-important"><a class="header" href="#why-is-the-stability-pool-important">Why is the Stability Pool important?</a></h2>
<p>The Stability Pool is essential to the RIME Protocol for several reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Debt Absorption</strong>: The Stability Pool absorbs the debt from liquidated Troves, ensuring that the total RUSD supply remains well-collateralized.</li>
<li><strong>Risk Mitigation</strong>: By absorbing liquidated debt, the Stability Pool helps protect the RIME ecosystem from the effects of sudden market fluctuations.</li>
<li><strong>Incentivized Participation</strong>: Participants in the Stability Pool are rewarded with liquidated collateral and RMT tokens, encouraging users to contribute and maintain the system's stability.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="how-to-participate-in-the-stability-pool"><a class="header" href="#how-to-participate-in-the-stability-pool">How to Participate in the Stability Pool</a></h2>
<p>To participate in the Stability Pool, follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Connect your wallet to the RIME web app.</li>
<li>Navigate to the &quot;Stability Pool&quot; section.</li>
<li>Deposit the desired amount of RUSD into the Stability Pool.</li>
<li>Monitor your rewards and claim them when you wish.</li>
</ol>
<p>Remember that the rewards you earn from the Stability Pool are proportional to your share of the total RUSD in the pool. As you contribute more RUSD, your share of the rewards will increase accordingly.</p>
<p>By participating in the Stability Pool, you not only help maintain the stability of the RIME Protocol but also have the opportunity to earn valuable rewards. Make sure to monitor your rewards and adjust your RUSD contribution as needed to maximize your returns.</p>
